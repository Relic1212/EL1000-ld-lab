1 Introduction
In this computer lab we are going to see how the control laws that we have
studied in this course can be used for controlling the position of a robot arm
shown in Figure 1. The project should be completed in groups of maximum
two students.
1.1 Background
Control of robot arms is a common problem in industry today. Imagine a
robot that picks up a part from a crate and puts it on a conveyor belt. If this
robot is a bottleneck in a factory, a speed increase of the robot will directly
influence the total production of the factory. Even a small improvement of
a few percent in the performance can give a big gain in the total number of
produced goods.

1.2 Goal
The goal of this lab is to design a lead-lag compensator and a state feedback
controller that can be used to control the robot in order to meet certain
specifications. The following concepts should have been understood by the
student by the end of the project:
• The relationship between time and frequency domain properties (for
both open and closed loop systems).
• The process of designing a lead-lag compensator to meet certain specifications.
• The concept of robustness and sensitivity.
• The principle behind a state feedback controller.
• The concept of pole placement design.
1.3 Examination
Examination is performed in a two step procedure.
The first step is when the whole project is completed. A MATLAB program
will be used to check that the designed controllers satisfy all the specifications. See Section 4 for more information.
The second step is a 15-minute oral examination. Before this examination
the following should have been prepared:
• Answers to all assignments on a separate paper. (Not to be handed
in.)
• MATLAB program that can instantaneously reproduce the results, and
with as many constants as possible analytically defined.
• Relevant plots, transfer functions and state space models should be
easily retrievable in your MATLAB program. (Hint: Look into dividing
the program into cells. See MATLAB help on cell dividers.)
• The students should be logged into a computer with the MATLAB
program ready to run before the examination starts.
• The code generated by correct input to the lab3robot program (see
below).
Note that the assignments should be solved numerically in MATLAB unless
they explicitly request an analytical answer.

2 Preparation
To be able to complete the project more easily the answers to the following
questions need to be understood.

plot?
frequency where 0 decibel

• What is the phase-margin and how can it be found in a Bode plot?
phi_m = phi - (-180 deg)

• How to derive the errors e0 and e1?
• How is the cross-over frequency, bandwidth, and rise time related?
• How is the overshoot, phase margin, amplitude margin and stability
related?
• Concerning a lead-lag controller:

– How does the design of the lag-part affect the design of the leadcontroller?
– Which frequency should the lead-lag controller mainly be designed
for?
– How are τD and τI usually defined?
– What effect does the parameter γ have and what is the effect of
setting γ to zero?
• What more information is contained in a state space model than in a
transfer function?
• What is the main difference between input-output feedback and state
feedback?
• Why can it be interesting to plot the sensitivity function? What information can be found in the sensitivity plot?
• What is a model error? What problems can a model error cause?
• What is the robustness criterion and what does it guarantee?

Moment of inertia J
The moment of inertia and a maximum control signal will be provided by
the function lab3robot. The file lab3robot.p (which can be downloaded
from the course homepage) contains a MATLAB function which can be used
as
[J,umax] = lab3robot(PersonalNumber)
where PersonalNumber denotes the birth date of one of the team members
which should be in the format YYMMDD (year, month and day). Since only
one value of J is needed, only use data from one of the team members (which
data it is does not matter). The same number is to be used when correcting
the solutions. The maximum value of the control signal, umax, which will be
used in the control design, is given by umax.
Assignment 1. Based on the block diagram in Figure 2, and the parameter values in Table 1, calculate the transfer function of the robot arm first
analytically and then print it out with numerical values.
G(s) = =

Check G(s) by writing lab3robot(G,PersonalNumber) in MATLAB. Be
sure that the current directory is where lab3robot.p has been placed after
being downloaded from the course homepage.
3.2 Proportional control
First we want to control the system using only a proportional controller.
This is shown in Figure 3 where F(s) = K. The signal v is a disturbance
that will be considered later, for now disregard it, i.e., v = 0.
Now assume that we have the following requirements on the unit step response of the closed loop system:
1. The overshoot should be less than 5%.
2. The rise time should be as short as possible.

3.3 Improved control
In this part we want to improve the performance of the control system by determining a loop-shaping (lead-lag) compensator which satisfies the following
specifications.
1. The overshoot should be less than 5% when the reference signal is a
unit step (same as before).
2. The closed loop system should be four times faster than what was
possible with proportional control.
3. The control signal should satisfy |u(t)| < umax for all t when the reference signal is a unit step, where umax is given by the function lab3robot
(see Section 3.1).
4. The stationary control error should be smaller than 0.05 when the
reference signal is a unit ramp (hint: a ramp is an integrated step),
r(t) = 
0 t < 0
t t ≥ 0
. (2)
Since we eventually want to apply the control law in practice we also have
the following requirements.
5. We do not want to amplify measurement disturbances too much, i.e.
the high-frequency amplification of the controller should not be made
unnecessarily large.
6. In order to decrease possible problems with nonlinearities we do not
want the controller gain for low frequencies to be too large.
Assignment 5. Answer the following questions:
• Which frequency domain property of the open-loop system is most
closely related to the rise time of the system? How should this be
changed in the case with a lead-lag compensator to make it four times
faster than the P-controller?
• What frequency domain property of the open-loop system should be
kept approximately the same to make sure the overshoot is under 5%?

Assignment 6. Determine the transfer function F(s) of a lead-lag compensator that satisfies the new specifications. Motivate the choice of parameters
τD, β, τI , and γ.
Hint: Start with designing a controller that satisfies specifications 1, 2 and 3,
and then augment this controller in order to satisfy specification 4. To check
specification 3, simulate u(t) when r(t) is a unit step.
To solve the assignment, the τI parameter in the lead-lag compensator may
need to deviate from the rule of thumb (see p. 109 in Glad & Ljung ver. 4).
If doing so, remember to compensate the modified phase lag by choosing another β.
F(s) = (3)

zero?

3.4 Sensitivity
Assignment 8. Calculate and plot the Bode diagram of the sensitivity
functions S(s) with the proportional controller and with the controller F(s)
from Assignment 6 in the same plot (hint: Bodemag(S1,S2)). The sensitivity
function is the transfer function from v to θL in Figure 3. For which frequencies do the controllers attenuate the effect of disturbances on the output?
For which frequencies are the effect of disturbances amplified?

3.5 Robustness
The axis that turns the robot arm is not completely stiff and thus the true
transfer function is given by
G
0
(s) = G(s)(1 + ∆G(s)) (4)
where ∆G(s) is the relative model error.

Two alternative descriptions of the model error have been proposed:
∆G1(s) = s + 10
40
and ∆G2(s) = s + 10
4(s + 0.01)
Assignment 9. Will the robustness criterion guarantee robust stability for
both of these model error descriptions (see p. 125 in Glad & Ljung ver. 4) with
the controller F(s) from Assignment 6? Motivate the answer with frequency
plots of the complementary sensitivity function T(s) and 1
∆G

3.6 State space model
Here we will work under the assumption that we are able to measure the
motor current, Ia, the motor shaft speed, ˙θm, in addition to the robot arm
angle, θL.
Assignment 10. Again study the block diagram of Figure 2. Find the state
space description of the system with the states x1 = θL, x2 = ˙θm and x3 = Ia.
Compute the matrices A, B and C analytically (do not use MATLAB, this
should be done by hand calculations)
x˙(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t)
A = B =

3.7 Pole placement
Having measurements of all states available allow for state feedback control.
The state feedback can be designed to meet different performance criteria.
Here the task is to design the feedback controller so as to obtain desired poles
in the closed-loop system, i.e., pole placement design.

Figure 4: Control system with state feedback.
The pole placement specifications are:
1. The system should be as fast as possible.
2. The overshoot should be less than 5% when the reference signal is a
unit step.
3. When the reference signal is a unit step the control signal must not
exceed umax (given by the function lab3robot).
4. The static gain of the closed loop system should be equal to 1.
Hint: see chapter 9 in Glad&Ljung ver. 4.

law which gives a closed loop system that satisfies the above requirements.

4 Examination
The examination is done by a two step procedure.
4.1 Validation of controllers
The validation program lab3robot.p should be downloaded from the course
homepage and put in the same folder as the newly written MATLAB program. To validate the derived controllers and models run the command
lab3robot(G,K,F,A,B,C,L,L0,PersonalNumber) where:
G is the transfer function for the robot system (Assignment 1)
K is the gain of P-controller (Assignment 2)
F is the lead-lag compensator (Assignment 6)
A, B, C is the state space model (Assignment 10)
L, L0 is the state feedback controller (Assignment 12)
PersonalNumber The birthdate of one group member in the format YYMMDD
If approved, a code will be generated. Bring this to the oral examination.
4.2 Oral Examination
The second step is a 15-minute oral examination. Before this examination
the following should have been prepared:
• Answers to all assignments on seperate paper. (Not to be handed in.)
• MATLAB program which can instantaneously reproduce the results
with as many constants as possible analytically defined.
• Relevant plots, transfer functions and state space models should be
easily retrievable in your MATLAB program. (Hint: Look into dividing
the program into cells. See MATLAB help on cell dividers.)
• The students should be logged into a computer with the MATLAB
program ready and open in time before the examination starts.
• The code generated by correct input to the lab3robot program.
A successful oral examination can only be performed when the first
step is complete and all values in the program have been validated
as correct and a code has been generated
